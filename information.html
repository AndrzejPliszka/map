    Hi. This is open source map project, which goal is to visualize The Great War (and various wars after it) with maps. This project (in contrast to mapping videos) has:<br>
    1. Easy navigation  (you can smoothly go back in time and stop at specific date);<br>
    2. Context, which cannot be shown on maps (you can see country information and hand written description which adds context);<br>
    3. Easy error fixing (website was made with error fixing in mind);<br><br>
    In my website you can instantly go forward and backward a time using arrows on screen, or on keyboard, click any country to know anything about it and see current events and battles while they take place. This website was designed to easily add and change maps, events, battles and so on, even outside the field of Great War, so it can be easily expanded or fixed when errors are found. <br>
    However, <em>do NOT use this website in it current stage as an academic source.</em> I am one guy programming, reasearching and drawing maps - I am NOT a historian, or expert in any way. Also<em> parliament images ARE NOT accurate </em>and they won't be accurate anytime soon. If you spot an error in my maps or descriptions (which is extremly likely), be sure to contact me on Discord (tag: _gnom_), so I can fix it and make this website as accurate as possible.

    <br><br>Current Roadmap:<br>
    Firstly I want to add fronts up to december 1916. These fronts are in order: western front, eastern front, serbian front, caucasian front, gallipoli, greece, ireland, middle east front(s), iran and finally africa.<br>
    After that I am going to work on 1917. Only if I finish 1917 I am going to make 1918 and so on, up to 24 July 1923. If you want to help me do this project, be sure to check <a href="contribution.html">this</a><br>
    <br>Thank you for reading and have a great day.
