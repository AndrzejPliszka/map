    You can contribute in many ways:
    <h2>Are you programmer? You can review my code!</h2>
    This is my first serious website, which of course means that much of my code is probably trash. But I don't know which parts are, until someone will tell me! If I know what I did wrong and what right, I will be able to be better, right? Unfortunatly I did not write comments, however names are mostly self explainatory.
    <h2>Are you UI designer? You can make my CSS decent!</h2>
    I do not expect anyone to spend couple days designing website for free, and I am not asking for that. I would be happy if you made design that looks better than my current one (which is not the best to say the least).
    <h2>Are you a mapper? You can make SVG maps!</h2>
    And these maps do not need to be of World War One. You can make map of anything, from railway connections, trade routes or cities to maps of different continents or wars not related to world war one. <br>My website is flexible enough that I can include any of that. <br>
    If you decide to make maps, they need to be <em>in SVG format and in equirectangular projection</em> (otherwise I will not be able to import them to my website) 
    <h2>Are you a historian? You can improve information quality!</h2>
    You can check out my tiny <a href="information.html">roadmap</a>, for information on what am I doing now. But if you found innacuraces (or other info that may be usefull for me), contact me anyway, so I can fix them.
    <h2>Are you history populiser? You can promote my project!</h2>
    This project "success" greatly depends on people actually using my website. And to make people use my website I need promotion, which I suck at. So, I would be gratefull, if you would show my project to your audience. I am also open to collaborations and your other propositions!
    <h2>Are you just regular user? You can give me feedback!</h2>
    Feedback is very important, especially for side like mine, which has very limited reach. If you have idea to improve my website, you have questions to ask or you just want to share your (even negative) opinion, you are welcome to write to me on discord (my tag is _gnom_).

    <br><br>
    All the things in here are important for my project development and you GREATLY contribute, if you help me in any of the above ways. I will not pay you unfortunatly, because I do not have any stable monetary income (I am not even 18 y.o.). But if you decide to help me despite that, I will be very, very gratefull. And only way that I can currently reward you is by putting your name in<a href="credits.html"> credits.</a><br>
    You can contact me with Discrod. My tag is _gnom_
